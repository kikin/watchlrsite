<p>Summary</p>
<p>kikin Inc. ("watchlr") is strongly committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy discloses how we collect, use and share information we gather about you on watchlr’s Web sites and the choices you have regarding our use of and your ability to correct the information. This Privacy Policy applies only to The watchlr’s Web sites and watchlr's Internet-enabled services (e.g. watchlr plug-in). We hope that this disclosure will enhance your experience on the Internet and reinforce the trust that you place in watchlr's products and services.</p>
<p>The watchlr plug-in works by recording your browsing history, including your search results pages. While watchlr never looks at terms you enter into a website, we look at the URL structure to identify terms that interest you so that we may serve relevant content to you. This data is stored on your computer, and from time to time, the watchlr plug-in will send truncated version of the URLs from your browsing history to our servers so that we can categorize the sites you visit. This information is deleted after categorization. Please read our privacy policy in full.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through the watchlr.com website, watchlr powered widgets, and through the watchlr plug-in. It does not apply to information collected by watchlr in any other way or to information collected separately by watchlr’s content, commerce and service providers and/or watchlr’s distributors. The watchlr.com website and watchlr search (search.watchlr.com), watchlr powered widgets (e.g. content that watchlr displays on other pages), and the watchlr plug-in are each designed to minimize collection of personally identifiable information that can be directly associated with the website visitor or the user. watchlr considers consumer and individual privacy to be paramount, while still providing you the user with an enhanced internet experience. For personal information of employees and users that watchlr receives from the European Economic Area, watchlr has committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles and the 15 FAQs. watchlr’s Safe Harbor certification can be found at http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list. For more information about the Safe Harbor Principles, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Website at http://export.gov/safeharbor/.   There are two means by which watchlr collects and uses information. These are through you visiting the watchlr.com website and through your download, installation, and use of the watchlr plug-in.</p>

<p>The watchlr.com website and watchlr powered widgets use cookies. A cookie is a small text file that contains a string of alphanumeric characters. There are two types of cookies that may be used at the watchlr.com website: a persistent cookie and a session cookie. A persistent cookie is entered by your Web browser into the Cookies folder on your computer and remains in this Cookies folder after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. A session cookie is entered by your Web browser into the Cookies folder on your computer and disappears after you close your browser or shut off your computer. The watchlr.com website and watchlr powered widgets may also use Web beacons (also called clear GIFs or pixel tags) in conjunction with cookies. Web beacons are small strings of software that are placed in a Web page. If you have arrived at this website by clicking on a banner ad at another website for one of watchlr’s or its partners’ products or services, a session cookie may be used. This cookie will contain an identification number for the ad that you clicked on, or will contain an identification number for the site that you were visiting when you clicked on the banner ad. This session cookie helps watchlr determine which of its ads attracts the most viewers. If, after you arrive at watchlr’s site, you choose to request further information from watchlr about its products and services, the personal information that you provide in that request will be linked to the information in the session cookie. This also helps watchlr measure the effectiveness of its advertising. This linking will not be used to target future advertisements to you or to send you emails about future goods and services. You will receive emails about watchlr’s products only if you explicitly make such a request on the product request page. Because this is a session cookie, it will disappear once you have closed your browser. If you return to watchlr’s site via another one of watchlr’s ads, you will appear as a new visitor unless and until you provide further personal information. The watchlr.com website and watchlr plug-in may use persistent cookies, Web beacons and information collected in watchlr’s log files (such as Internet Protocol addresses, referring URLs, etc.) about your activity at this site to better understand how the website and the plug-in is used, to resolve technical problems, and to enhance your experience at this site.</p>

<p>watchlr’s plug-in collects and uses certain information in order to perform its functions. When you download and install watchlr’s plug-in, watchlr assigns a unique identifier to that instance of the plug-in. Part of this identifier indicates the source of the download so that watchlr may fulfill its contractual obligations with distributors of its plug-in. The remainder of the identifier is essentially a random number that facilitates communication between your browser and watchlr’s servers. This unique identifier is not associated with you personally but rather with your browser. Installing and using the watchlr plug-in does not require you to register or provide any information that can be directly associated with you, such as name, address or email. When you install and configure watchlr’s plug-in, you are presented with a series of choices, which you may access and modify at any time. These choices may include the automatic detection of the websites you visit most frequently. watchlr presents these choices to you so that it can improve your results from the plug-in by expanding its partner relationships.</p>

<p>Because watchlr respects your privacy, watchlr’s plug-in will record only a portion of your IP address. This is so that watchlr can generally understand the geographic properties of the IP address, while providing you with the protection of not keeping the entire IP address. watchlr’s plug-in will also record, as its primary function, 1) the search queries that you enter into your browser’s search box or on your preferred search provider’s webpage, 2) URLs of web pages that you visit and keywords present on those web pages.  watchlr’s plug-in will forward a copy of each search query, URL, or keyword to watchlr’s computer servers where it will compare this data against content available from its content partners. watchlr maintains a record of each search query, URL, or keyword and the associated partial IP address, time stamp, and plug-in identifier, so that watchlr may improve the quality of its service and manage its contractual commitments with its partners.  The watchlr plug-in does not record any data that a user may enter into a data field on a web page.  While the plug-in will retain your browsing history if you configure it to do so, this data is stored only on your computer. On a regular basis, the watchlr plug-in will send a truncated version of the URLs from your browsing history. For example, if you view a video on YouTube the watchlr plug-in would send to our server only www.youtube.com and not the full URL. watchlr uses this truncated URL to categorize the particular sites you visit, such as ‘news,’ ‘sports’ or ‘entertainment.’ watchlr then immediately deletes the truncated URL from our server. watchlr’s computer servers are located in different countries around the world and records of search queries, URLs, keywords and related data may be shared among different servers to improve the quality and speed of the watchlr service.</p>
<p>Each time you visit watchlr.com or watchlr Search, we collect the limited information that your browser makes available whenever you visit any website. This information includes: (a) [only a portion of your] Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited before clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Firefox browser on a Macintosh platform); and (d) your browser language. Additionally, when you enter a search query using the watchlr Sites or Services, we will receive the query text and process it, together with the above data, to return a search results page to you. If you have modified your browser settings so that address-bar search queries, browser search box and erroneous domain name system (DNS) requests are submitted to us, we may also receive any search query or misspelled URL that you enter into your browser's address bar.</p>

<p>The watchlr.com website will collect personally identifiable information about you only when you submit comments or questions using the “Contact Us” or “Feedback” forms on the website or from the watchlr Plug-in. Information you submit via these forms, like the search query data, may be transferred to watchlr resources in another country in order to respond to your comment or question. Please be aware that, if you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), information you submit via these forms may be transferred to a country that does not have similar levels of data protection.</p>

<p>watchlr will not retain information for any longer than appropriate and will delete data from our server log files after a six month period. Specifically, if watchlr’s plug-in is uninstalled from your computer, the aforementioned functionality will no longer be provided and no information collection will occur thereafter. If you un-install the plug-in, the un-installation process will include communication to our server that your plug-in has been removed. You may request to have any information associated with your plug-in removed from our system. You must make this request before un-installing the plug-in so that watchlr will be able to ascertain the plug-in identifier and then delete the appropriate files. Your request must be sent to support@watchlr.com.</p>

None of the information that watchlr provides these companies identifies you specifically. If the advertising company is responsible for delivering the ad to your browser, then the watchlr plug-in will provide your full IP address to the advertising company to do so. watchlr is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance supporting and upholding the regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please contact watchlr at privacy@watchlr.com.

If the user is not active on watchlr after 30 days, the cached data is deleted. The user's cached data is also deleted within 24 hours if the user disconnects the third party application from watchlr. Please read the third party’s privacy policy prior to consenting for more information on the types of information that will be shared. This cached information will be accessed by the watchlr client, which resides on the user’s computer or mobile device. If any of your personal information is collected in the cache process, watchlr will protect and manage that data in compliance with applicable law and any requirements imposed by the third party whose application you have linked to your instance of the watchlr plug-in.</p>
